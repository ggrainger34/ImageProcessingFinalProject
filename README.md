# Image Processing for Engineering and Science Specialization - Final Project üì∑üìê

This is the final project for a 40 hour online course by MathWorks. The course can be found here:

The task of this project is to analyse video footage of a busy road and draw a bounding box around the cars. As well as creating a table for the average number of pixels on screen in a given frame.

The program is able to recognise cars even when they are split in half by the pole to the left of the frame.

However, the program sometimes struggles to recognise car on the far lane. Morphological closing might be too aggressive, sometimes causing the cars on the far lane to disappear.

Only MATLAB is required to run this program.
